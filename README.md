# The Ultimate Serial Console for Engineers, Developers, and Others
Simply a seriously sweetened serial terminal

This is my own tool. It is meant to be used by me. The code is not written to be read or understood by others.
It is super hacky on some points. It is seriously over-engineered on other points. It is definitely a mess.

It is a monster.

I will not put an effort in fixing others issues, merging stuff or answer questions.

That said, you may do what the heck you want with it.  Cheers!
